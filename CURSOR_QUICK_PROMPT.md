## Ambient Video Studio - Immediate Optimization

This is a **YouTube ambient video creation tool** (like "The Relaxed Guy" channel). It combines video loops with AI-generated audio to create 8-10 hour ambient videos.

### Quick Analysis Needed:

1. **Fix any obvious bugs** in PowerShell scripts and GUI
2. **Improve the WinForms GUI** - better layout, error handling, user feedback
3. **Optimize FFmpeg commands** for better video quality and processing speed
4. **Add input validation** - prevent crashes from bad files or settings
5. **Enhance user experience** - progress bars, status updates, tooltips

### Key Files to Focus On:
- `Ambient_Video_GUI.ps1` - Main interface (needs UX improvements)
- `Tools/ambient_video_creator.ps1` - Core video processing (optimize FFmpeg)
- `Tools/content_sourcer.ps1` - Research tool (improve output formatting)

### Priority Fixes:
1. **Error handling** - graceful failures with helpful messages
2. **File path validation** - ensure all paths work correctly
3. **Progress feedback** - show users what's happening during long operations
4. **GUI responsiveness** - prevent freezing during video processing

**Goal:** Make it professional, reliable, and user-friendly for content creators.
